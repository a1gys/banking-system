# banking-system
Interactive banking system with initial database. The database in .csv format.
The program is made in OOP and contains several functions such as withdraw or deposit.
Known bugs includes withdrawing or depositting negative amount of sum.

The main principles of OOP that have been used are polymorphism, encapsulation, file handling. In fact, inheritance could also be used, but I could not figure out how to implement it properly. In file handling parts, the same part of code was reused over and over again with slight changes due to the specification of given functions.
